# Waifu-Image-Generator
This repository contains a simple web page that generates a random "waifu" (a female anime/manga character) image using the waifu.im API. The page displays the image, its source, and a button that allows the user to generate a new image.

# Usage
To use this web page, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The page will load a random waifu image and display it in the center of the page. The source of the image will be displayed below the image.

To generate a new image, simply click the "New Waifu Image" button below the image. The page will fetch a new image from the waifu.im API and replace the current image with the new one.

# Dependencies
This web page depends on the following:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the page structure and content.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the page styles.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that fetches the waifu image from the API and updates the page content.
